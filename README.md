This outlines shader, applies outlines to 3D objects of your choice but works best on objects with rounded edges. 
It is based on the work from wikibooks (Link:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Outlining_Objects) but with added features such as a silhouette covering the object when the object is behind other objects and the use of toggles to turn off or on both the outlines and the silhouette.
